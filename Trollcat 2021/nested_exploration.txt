Description: Login 69 times and maybe you get lucky

Solution:
This was simple challenge which asked us to login 69 times, if we try to login we can see another prompt appears
just below the current prompt.

Capture the request with burpsuite and we can see that no values are being passed in the request and there is a single cookie which is id=1

(or you can set the value of the cookie in the storage section of browser using the developers too. In Firefox, open the developers tools with Ctrl+Shift+I, then go to Storage Tab->Cookies and there you can set the value of the parameter by double clicking it)

If we change the value to any value then it seems to affect the number of prompts which would mean that the count
of the input prompt is maintained by this.

Since we want 69 we can try inserting that in the id and then send the request but that did not  give the flag.
Now if we send id=0 we can see only one prompt which means that the counting for the prompt starts from 0 and the
69th request would be 68 but if we send 68 we don't get the flag in the response.
But if we send 67 in the request we get the flag in the response
