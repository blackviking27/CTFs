Solution: 
A rar file is given to us in this challenge.
When extracting the file we are prompted for a password.
Initial password is 'trollcat'

After this we get another file openme.rar and a hint.txt
The hint.txt had this

----------]<-<---<-------<---------->>>>+[<<<<------------,>++++++++++++++++++,<---,,----,++++++++,---,++++++++++++++,-----,----------,+++++,-,-----,++++++++++++,>+++,<++++,,-,---------,

This is a BrainFuck code but when I tried running ,it didn't work.
I looked at different variants of this programming language utilizing the same symbols but was not able to find one
that worked.

I was not able to move ahead, after the CTF I got to know that there is ReverseFuck and that was what was needed
for this challenge

We can use this: https://www.dcode.fr/reversefuck-language

After running that we get this password: 'p4sswordisnoth1dden'

We can use this to extract the openme.rar

This again gives two files 'You did it.rar' and You_are_very_close.txt

The txt file had this hint
'
	Have you ever heard about hashes?
	try it out you might find something interesting ;)

'

This indicates towards the md5 of a file.
You can get the md5 of a file with this command: md5sum You_are_very_close.txt
The md5 hash is : aab2ee6281c7c190e7ae2c4cacddad52

Using this as the password we can extract the rar file
