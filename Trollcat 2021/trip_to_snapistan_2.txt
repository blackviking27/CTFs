Solution:
There is a link to a snap story
Looking at the snap story reveals two things, Al Muhammadyah and Le Conche(which is not the full name)

Reading the description on the tissue paper on the right we can say that it was a cafe

Al Muhammadiyah is a place in Saudi Arabia.
I googled this ' cafes in "Al Muhammadiyah" '
I put the place name in double quotes because that needed to be in the result

I opened the list of Cafe's that were shown in the google maps and found the name of the Cafe : Le Concheur
There was website for which was mentioned for the cafe

Going in the contact us of the webpage we can get the phone number of the cafe
