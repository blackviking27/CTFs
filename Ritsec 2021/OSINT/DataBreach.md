# Data Breach

### Description
Oh no! Genoâ€™s email was involved in a data breach! What was his password?

### Solution
WE have geno's email `incogeno@gmail.com`. From linkedin profile we can find a link to personal website which has link to many other social platforms. Thry did not have anything useful.
If you go to haveIbeenpawned and searched for the email you would get result saying that it wasn't involved in a leak. Now if you google `"incogeno@gmail.com."` (with double quotes), you will 
get a single link which has the password for the user
