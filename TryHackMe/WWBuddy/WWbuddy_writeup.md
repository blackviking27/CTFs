# Write up for WWBuddy on <a href='https://tryhackme.com/room/wwbuddy'>TryHackMe</a>

### Website Flag

The webpage gives us a login page, I tried for sql injection which didn't work. I registered an account and looked around I could only see **WWBuddy** user which looks like a bot.
There is a message saying that we can send message to any user that we can find on the webpage. I couldn't find anything interesting so I ran [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).
