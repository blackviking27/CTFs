If you visit the /.git we can see a forbidden message (I found this dir as a hit and trial method to look for default dirs). We can get the files using the <a href='https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper'>git dumper</a>
This will download the files for you. Now if you run <b>git show</b> in the dir which has the files then we can see that at some point there was a flag.jpg in the index.html.
We can use <a href='https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools'>Git Tools</a> to extract the deleted file.
Run the <b>extractor.sh</b> in the Extractor folder and specify the dir which has the website's file and the dir you want to extract to
<h4>./extractor.sh {Dir which has the website's git files} {Destination dir}</h4>
Now inside the extracted files you can find the flag at <b>2-146831302c94e3dfed16c9a90baed8770a82b544/meme_stash</b>
<h4>FLAG: darkCON{g1t_d4_fl4g}</h4>
